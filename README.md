# SP-Switch-API
What does it do
---
SP Switch API uses the Player 2 input as an independent control channel to switch between different Start Positions. The system reads the P2 input and toggles a teletransportation trigger in game, that disables the current Start Position and enables the next one simultaneously, while Player 1 gameplay remains unaffected.

How to use
---
Copy and paste the system into your level and enable 2-Player mode. Move each Start Position object (shining stars) to your selected position. During gameplay, use Player 2 input to switch between Start Positions while playing with Player 1, unaffected in gameplay.
